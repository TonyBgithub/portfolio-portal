  Documentation Portal
</h1>
Hi! Welcome to my GitHub! This is the repo for my documentation portal. To see a live demo, follow this link: https://tb-documentation-portal.netlify.app/

## Inspiration
I built this portal using Gatsby, inspired from Twilio's SendgGrid docs. 
Since my focus was on integration more than design for this project, I used Twilio's style guide. 

## Refactoring
I have rewritten parts of the code to include React hooks and replaced class components with functional components.

Thanks for taking the time to review my work!

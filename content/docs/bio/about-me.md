## Bio
My name is Tony Briget, I'm a technical writer based near Paris, France. For more details, see my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tony-briget-52640017a/" target="_blank">LinkedIn profile</a>. I'm currently working on expanding my knowledge of API documentation and coding in general, exploring new areas and experimenting with code snippets that I include in my projects. 

## Samples of My Work

### This website
I built this documentation website using <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/" target="_blank">Gatsby</a>, a static site generator. Most of what you read on this website is Markdown transformed into HTML at build time. Gatsby uses GraphQL to query metadata from markdown files and build seamless navigation.

### Building documentation sites with embedded API documentation
I have experience with OxygenXML and DITA but I keep an eye open for other ways to write, display and review documentation. See my other <a href="https://tb-apidocs.netlify.app/apidocs/1.0/" target="_blank">developer portal</a> hosted on Netlify.

### Videos
Last year, part of my work at SAP involved shooting and editing documentation videos. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aENAqA82wdo" target="_blank">my work on SAP's Youtube Channel</a>.

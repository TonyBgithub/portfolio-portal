  Documentation Portal

Hi ! Welcome to my documentation portal! Thank you for taking the time to review my work!

## Inspiration
I built this portal using Gatsby and got inspiration from Twilio's SendgGrid docs.
I used their style guide since my aim was to focus on integration more than design.

## Refactoring
I have rewritten parts of the code to include React hooks and replaced class components with functional components.

Thanks for taking the time to review my work!
